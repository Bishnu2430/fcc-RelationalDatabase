# üìÇ Relational Database Course Projects (FreeCodeCamp)  

This repository contains all the projects I completed as part of the **Relational Database** course on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/). The course covers SQL fundamentals, database design, and PostgreSQL, helping to build a strong foundation in relational databases.   

## üöÄ Projects Included  
Below is a list of the projects completed during the course:  

1. **Celestial Bodies Database** - For this project, you will build a database of celestial bodies using PostgreSQL.
2. **World Cup Database** - For this project, you will create a Bash script that enters information from World Cup games into PostgreSQL, then query the database for useful statistics.  
3. **Salon Appointment Scheduler** - For this project, you will create an interactive Bash program that uses PostgreSQL to track the customers and appointments for your salon. 
4. **Periodic Table Database** - For this project, you will create a Bash script to get information about chemical elements from a periodic table database.  
5. **Number Guessing Game** - For this project, you will use Bash scripting, PostgreSQL, and Git to create a number guessing game that runs in the terminal and saves user information.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used  
- PostgreSQL  
- SQL  
- pgAdmin (optional for database management)  
- Bash (for running scripts)
